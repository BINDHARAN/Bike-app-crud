        "details": "The Husqvarna Vektorr is the first electric scooter from the Swedish brand that was showcased as a concept in May 2021. The e-scooter takes some design cues from the Svartpilen/Vitpilen models, with its flat, round LED headlight, simple body panels and neon accents.Husqvarna is yet to reveal all the technical specifications of the Vektorr, however, it is claimed to have a range of 95km and a top speed of 45kmph. The claimed range of the concept is exactly the same as the Chetak, hinting that the two e-scooters might have more in common than meets the eye. Just like the Bajaj Chetak, the Husqvarna Vektorr rides on 12-inch wheels and gets a unique single-sided front monoshock. The Chetak’s BLDC motor -- producing a peak output of 4.08kW and 16Nm -- could be carried over to the Vektorr."

Powering the Cafe Racer is a 961cc parallel-twin motor that produces a power of 80PS at 6500rpm and a peak torque of 90Nm at 5200rpm. The Indian version is, however, less powerful with power and torque rated at 72.8PS at 7500rpm and 67Nm at 6500rpm respectively. Suspension duties at the front are handled by 43mm Ohlins USD forks adjustable for preload, rebound damping and compression. At the rear, it comes equipped with Ohlins twin shock absorbers.
